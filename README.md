## What Is YOLO Object Detection and why?
  You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a network that uses Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for object detection. 
  YOLO performs object detection by classifying certain objects within the image and determining where they are located on it

## YOLO V3
   YOLO V3 is an incremental upgrade over YOLO V2, which uses another variant of Darknet. 
   This YOLO V3 architecture consists of 53 layers trained on Imagenet. even thoughyolov4, yolov5 has released ,still Yolo v3 is famous  
   and used in many industrial applications.

## Yolov3 specs:

 * Improved bounding box prediction
 * More accurate class predictions
 * Improved abilities at different scales

## training:
